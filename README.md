full-crud-app

# Dov Stokar / May 7, 2017

# Explanations of the technologies used
### I used Express to create a full crud application using a database of three tables

#Approach taken
## First approach :
### I used quotes app as reference to create my file structure

## Second approach :
### I needed to render the join table I used and it worked kind of the way I wanted but not fully. I wanted to render all the exercises in each workout on the workout-single page but I got an error on the pages that didnt have any exercises.  

# User stories
### The user can add exercises and create workouts and store their workouts for later use.

# Wireframes
### all wireframes are in the assets folder.


# How-to-use instructions
## - Home page (super motivational!)
### - the nav bar gives you options to crud exercises and workouts
### - on each workout page you can see the exercises saved 




# Unsolved problems
### - can't add exercises to workouts
### - css is very plain and similar to quotes app
### - can't edit the exercises in each workout

#Thing I wanted to do:
### catigorize workouts
### on same page as the exercises you can click on the ones you want to save and then submit them into a workout, similar to the hacker news app
### search through exercises
### login each user to save thier workouts
